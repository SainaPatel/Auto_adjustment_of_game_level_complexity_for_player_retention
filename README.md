# Auto_adjustment_of_game_level_complexity_for_player_retention

For every gaming company the most important part is to retain their players, for this they have to make their game addictive as well as keep updating it. But along with this, understanding their players is also important, for example do they like it, whether they are on the verge of leaving the game, etc. For this analysis of game player data is important.

In this project, I have created a sample game player data for a game called as “FREE FLOW”.
	
In this game the player has to connect all the matching color dots, with less number of moves. There are certain minimum set of moves for every game, which is called best value. 

If a player has his number of moves equal to best value, it indicates he is very well going with the game, whereas the more the number of moves and reattempts a player takes, it shows that player is having difficulty.

In this analysis, I have taken two kind of data, 
1. How many hours a day the player plays the game
2. The number of moves the player takes to finish the game.

First identify, the average number of moves for every game. If the number of moves is very high compared to best number of moves, then the players are finding it difficult. Hence, we should provide them with hints and try making it easier for the players.

Second, we analyze every single player data, 
•	The number of moves per game and daily time, if we see that number of moves are way higher than the best move plus the daily time of the player is reducing, then it shows that player is losing interest and hence, we should try making it easy for him to retain him,
•	On the other side, if a player’s number of moves is very close to best moves, then he is finding it easy and he will eventually loose interest if it is easy for him. If maximum number of players are finding it easy, we should try making it difficult.

From, this data we can also find out total number of players and hence, we can advertise it to bring more customers.
